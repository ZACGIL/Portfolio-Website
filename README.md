# Portfolio-Website
Hi!

My name is Zac Gilfoyle.

## Description
This repository contains HTML, CSS and various assets used to create my first personal portfolio website for the early stages of my coding bootcamp.

This website is a culmination of the skills developed in the first couple weeks of the course and utilizes flexbox in the CSS to create a reponsive website layout.

On the portfolio page you can find links to my previous projects as well as my work-related contact information.

Below is an image of the website's current layout as well as a link to the deployed application.
